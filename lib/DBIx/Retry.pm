=head1 NAME

DBIx::Retry - DBIx::Connector with the ability to retry the run method for a specified amount of time.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBIx::Retry;
  my $conn = DBIx::Retry->new($dsn, $user, $tools, {retry_time => 5});
	
  # all other method are inherited from DBIx::Connector
  my $dbh = $conn->dbh;  #get a database handle
	
  # Do something with the handle - will retry for specified amount of time, should the database connection be lost
  $conn->run(fixup => sub {
    $_->do('INSERT INTO foo (name) VALUES (?)', undef, 'Fred' );
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::Retry is extended from DBIx::Connector. It adds the ability to keep retrying to connect to a database for a specified amount of time in order to execute DBIx::Connector's run method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 retry_time 
	Amount of seconds to retry re-connecting to database, should the database become unavailable. 

=head2 verbose 
	Enable verbose output.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new DBIx::Retry object.
	my $conn = DBIx::Retry->new($dsn, $user, $tools,{timeout => 5, verbose => 1});

=head1 USAGE

Simply create a new DBIx::Retry object:

  my $conn = DBIx::Retry->new($dsn, $user, $tools, {retry_time => 5});

Then wrap your operations inside the run method that is inherited from DBIx::Connector:

  $conn->run(fixup => sub {
    $_->do('INSERT INTO foo (name) VALUES (?)', undef, 'Fred' );
  });

Should the connection to the database be lost then DBIx::Retry will retry to connect to the database for the amount of	seconds specified in the "retry_time" attribute.
